Linear dynamical systems (aka Kalman filters) 

It provides matlab packages to learn parameters for linear dynamical systems (kalman filters).
It contains the following package:

1. dynammo
  Expectation-Maximization algorithm to learn the parameters of a linear dynamical system. 
  There also also additional code for learning with missing observations and recovering the missing values. 
  located in the dynammo subdirectory
  check out make demo
  
2. PLiF
  a package for extracting shift invariant and harmonics features from time series. 
  
3. Bolero
  a package for missing value imputation for human motion capture sequence, utilizing the human body skeleton
  
4. CLDS
  a package for learning complex-valued dynamical systems
